Title: Migrating to Pelican
Date: 2019-09-21 08:00

After some extended hiatus, trying to pick up writing this blog again. I have also decided to migrate to [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/).

I have found these resources to be useful during the migration:

* [rasor.github.io](https://rasor.github.io/using-pelican-blog-on-github-pages.html)
* [anotherdatum.com](http://anotherdatum.com/pelican-and-github-pages-workflow.html)
